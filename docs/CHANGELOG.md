## How to Update This File

At the end of each week (Sunday planning session):

1. Fill in "Shipped" with what you actually completed
2. Note anything you "Learned" (bugs, surprises, insights)
3. Track "Hours spent" to calibrate future estimates
4. Move incomplete items to next week or cut them

This log becomes LinkedIn content. One post per week = 12 weeks of build-in-public.
